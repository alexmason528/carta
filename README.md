## Quick start

1. Clone this repo using `git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/react-boilerplate/react-boilerplate.git`
1. Run `npm run setup` to install dependencies and clean the git repo.<br />
   *We auto-detect `yarn` for installing packages by default, if you wish to force `npm` usage do: `USE_YARN=false npm run setup`*<br />
   *At this point you can run `npm start` to see the example app at `http://localhost:3000`.*
1. Run `npm run clean` to delete the example app.

Now you're ready to rumble!

Please note that this boilerplate is **production-ready and not meant for beginners**! If you're just starting out with react or redux, please refer to https://github.com/petehunt/react-howto instead. If you want a solid, battle-tested base to build your next product upon and have some experience with react, this is the perfect start for you.
